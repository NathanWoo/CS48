          UCSB Club Recommender is a web application to help incoming college students to select the club(s) that would best match them.
          Unlike similar club searching platforms, this recommender sorts relevant organizations by their ratings and allows for peer reviews.
          Critically, UCSB Club Recommender tailors the results to best fit the studentsâ€™ unique interests and desires based on personalized queries.
